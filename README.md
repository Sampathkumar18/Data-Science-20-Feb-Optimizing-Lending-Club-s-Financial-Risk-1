PROJECT TITLE: 
LENDING CLUB'S LOAN APPROVAL OPTIMIZATION BY REDUCING THE DEFAULTER’S PERCENTAGE

AIM: 
Performing various analysis on lending club’s loan applicant’s historical data and identifying the key terms which helps the organisation to reduce their financial risk. 

INTRODUCTION:
	Lending Club founded with the idea that bringing borrowers and investors together can help everybody succeed. This platform helps borrowers take control of their debt and empowers everyone to reach their financial goals. Generally, lending companies makes profits from the various interest rate which they charge from the customers. Customers with less risk, they charge them low interest rate and customers with high risk they charge them high interest rate.  In order to make more profit out of high interest rate, they provide loans to many risky customers who’s really not eligible for getting loan and due to this, most of the risky customers will not be repaying their principal loan amount and interest amount properly. sometimes this will make the company go in loss.   So, in this project we are going to design a model which will optimize the loan approval by reducing the defaulter customers percentage using historical data of the Lending Club’s loan applicants and will be creating the web application for the ease of end user.
